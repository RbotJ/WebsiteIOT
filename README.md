**IoT Platform Architecture Blueprint**

## **Overview**

The IoT platform is a centralized system for managing and monitoring ESP32 IoT devices, hosted on Railway with a **NodeJS backend** and an **Angular frontend**. The platform supports **OTA updates**, real-time monitoring, and device provisioning.

---

## **1. System Architecture**

### **Technology Stack**

- **Frontend:** Angular
- **Backend:** NodeJS (ExpressJS)
- **Database:** MySQL (Railway Managed), Redis (Caching & Session Management)
- **Message Broker:** MQTT (Mosquitto) for real-time device communication
- **Firmware Storage:** Railway Storage
- **Authentication:** JWT-based user authentication
- **Device Communication:** WebSockets + REST API
- **Logging & Monitoring:** Prometheus/Grafana, Logflare (Railway Integration)

---

## **2. Development Roadmap (Step-by-Step)**

This roadmap breaks down the development into **small, manageable tasks** suitable for an intern working 1-2 hours per day.

### **Week 1: Environment Setup & Basic API**

#### **Week 1 Breakdown (Daily Tasks)**

**Day 1: Setting Up *****Development***** Environment (Completed Tasks & Next Steps)**

-

**Day 2: Initialize Backend (NodeJS + ExpressJS) (Completed Tasks)**

- [x] Created a new **NodeJS project** inside Codespaces.
- [x] Installed essential dependencies:
  ```sh
  npm install express dotenv cors pg jsonwebtoken bcryptjs
  ```
- [x] Created `server.js` in the root directory and set up a basic Express server.
- [x] Configured `.env` file for managing environment variables.
- [x] Committed and pushed the backend setup to GitHub for Railway deployment.

-

**Day 3: Database Setup (MySQL on Railway) (Completed Tasks)**

- [x] Created a **MySQL database** on Railway.
- [x] Connected to the database using **pgAdmin** or **DBeaver**.
- [x] Implemented a database connection file (`src/config/db.js`).
- [x] Created initial database tables for `users` and `devices`.
- [x] Added environment variable `DATABASE_URL` in Railway settings.
- [x] Pushed the updates to GitHub and deployed the backend on Railway.

-

**Day 4: Implement Basic API Endpoints (Authentication)**

-

**Day 5: Testing API Locally & Code Documentation**

-

By completing these steps, the backend API will be functional with user authentication, database integration, and JWT-based security, forming the foundation for the rest of the IoT platform.

## **3. API Routes (NodeJS Backend)**

### **User Authentication**

| Endpoint         | Method | Description                       |
| ---------------- | ------ | --------------------------------- |
| `/auth/register` | POST   | Register a new user               |
| `/auth/login`    | POST   | Authenticate and return JWT token |
| `/auth/logout`   | POST   | Logout user                       |
| `/auth/refresh`  | POST   | Refresh JWT token                 |

### **Device Management**

| Endpoint              | Method | Description                   |
| --------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------- |
| `/devices/register`   | POST   | Register a new ESP32 device   |
| `/devices/:id`        | GET    | Get device details            |
| `/devices/:id/status` | GET    | Fetch latest device status    |
| `/devices/:id/update` | POST   | Initiate OTA firmware update  |
| `/devices/:id/delete` | DELETE | Remove device from the system |

### **Firmware Management**

| Endpoint               | Method | Description                          |
| ---------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `/firmware/upload`     | POST   | Upload new firmware version          |
| `/firmware/list`       | GET    | Retrieve available firmware versions |
| `/firmware/:id/delete` | DELETE | Delete firmware version              |

### **Real-time Communication (MQTT Topics)**

| Topic                       | Description                   |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `device/{device_id}/status` | Sends device heartbeat/status |
| `device/{device_id}/ota`    | Triggers OTA firmware update  |
| `device/{device_id}/logs`   | Streams logs from device      |

## **4. Database Schema (MySQL)**

### **Users Table**

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### **Devices Table**

```sql
REATE TABLE devices (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    device_code VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'offline',
    firmware_version VARCHAR(50),
    last_seen TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

### **Firmware Table**

```sql
CREATE TABLE firmware (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    version VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    file_url TEXT NOT NULL,
    uploaded_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

---

## **5. Security Considerations**

- **JWT Authentication:** Secure endpoints for users & devices.
- **MQTT ACLs:** Restrict device communication to authorized topics.
- **Firmware Signing:** Ensure firmware authenticity before OTA update.
- **SSL Encryption:** Secure all communications between devices and backend.

---

## **6. Deployment & Scaling**

- **Hosting:** Railway for backend & database, Netlify/Vercel for Angular frontend.
- **Load Balancing:** Use Railway‚Äôs auto-scaling features.
- **Monitoring:** Integrate Logflare, Prometheus/Grafana for logging and analytics.

---

## **7. Next Steps**

- Follow the roadmap step by step to build a functional prototype.
- Review progress weekly and refine tasks based on requirements.
- Ensure documentation is updated throughout the development process.

This structured plan helps break the project into small steps, making it manageable for an intern. Let me know if you need modifications!

## Device Firmware Status 3/22/25
-work on adding these additional features
    üîÅ Manual reboot button

üîß /reset_wifi endpoint to clear WiFi creds

üß™ /test_update endpoint for debugging forced updates

üóÉÔ∏è Add device ID or MAC address display

üìÖ Uptime or last reboot info

üì° Scan for nearby WiFi networks

Captive Portal Redirect on ESP32
You‚Äôll need to:

Serve a simple web page on /

Respond to DNS requests to redirect all hostnames to your ESP32 (aka "DNS hijacking")

Trigger the device‚Äôs captive portal detection by handling common URLs

-Add custom styling or branding to that page?

-Serve it from SPIFFS so it looks like a full app?

-Auto-reboot after successful save?
